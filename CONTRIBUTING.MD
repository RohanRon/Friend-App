#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Please note Windows 10 Mobile is currently not fully stable** hence it contains bugs that are in the system. Thus the system could exhibit unusual behavior which includes sudden closing of app and app not starting. In these cases please restart your phone first to see if the app still displays the behavior. **
* Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
